        <p>A <span class="bold-me">submarine</span> (or <span class="bold-me">sub</span>) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater. It differs from a
            submersible, which has more limited underwater capability. It is also sometimes used historically or
            colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels,
            such as the midget submarine and the wet sub. Submarines are referred to as "boats" rather than "ships"
            irrespective of their size.</p>
        <p>Although experimental submarines had been built before, submarine design took off during the 19th century,
            and they were adopted by several navies. Submarines were first widely used during World War I (1914–1918),
            and are now used in many navies large and small. Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships
            (merchant and military), or other submarines, aircraft carrier protection, blockade running, ballistic
            missile submarines as part of a nuclear strike force, reconnaissance, conventional land attack (for example
            using a cruise missile), and covert insertion of special forces. Civilian uses for submarines include marine
            science, salvage, exploration and facility inspection and maintenance. Submarines can also be modified to
            perform more specialized functions such as search-and-rescue missions or undersea cable repair. Submarines
            are also used in tourism and undersea archaeology.</p>
        <p>Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical (or conical) ends and a vertical
            structure, usually located amidships, which houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes.
            In modern submarines, this structure is the "sail" in American usage and "fin" in European usage. A "conning
            tower" was a feature of earlier designs: a separate pressure hull above the main body of the boat that
            allowed the use of shorter periscopes. There is a propeller (or pump jet) at the rear, and various
            hydrodynamic control fins. Smaller, deep-diving and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this
            traditional layout. Submarines use diving planes and also change the amount of water and air in ballast
            tanks to change buoyancy for submerging and surfacing.</p>

    <h1>Etymology</h1>
    <p>Whereas the principal meaning of "submarine" is an armed, submersible warship, the more general meaning is for
        any type of submersible craft. The definition as of 1899 was for any type of "submarine boat". By naval
        tradition, submarines are still usually referred to as "boats" rather than as "ships", regardless of their size.
        In other navies with a history of large submarine fleets they are also "boats"; in German it is an <span class="italisize-me">Unterseeboot</span>
        or <span class="italisize-me">U-Boot</span> (under-sea boat) and in Russian it is a подводная лодка (underwater boat). Although referred to
        informally as "boats", U.S. submarines employ the designation USS (United States Ship) at the beginning of their
        names, such as USS Alabama.</p>
